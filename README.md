My own simple physics simulator and bridge builder game written in Pygame for a school project.

The code is split into multiple files, but I left a large degree of intercommunication between the component modules, 
so it needs to load a reference to a 'game' game handler for most other objects, at least for painting stuff to display. 

This probably isn't the best way for doing this but doing it another way would require a rewrite of a lot of code, and since it works I just deciced to leave it as-is.
